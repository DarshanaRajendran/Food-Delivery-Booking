11111) HUB

A network hub is a node that broadcasts data to every computer or Ethernet-based device connected to it. A hub is less sophisticated than a switch, 
the latter of which can isolate data transmissions to specific devices. 
Network hubs are best suited for small, simple local area network (LAN) environments.


What is switch in computer network and types?

Switches are networking devices operating at layer 2 or a data link layer of the OSI model. 
They connect devices in a network and use packet switching to send, receive or forward data packets or data frames over the network.
 A switch has many ports, to which computers are plugged in

ROUTER

A router is a device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks. 
It serves two primary functions: managing traffic between these networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses, 
and allowing multiple devices to use the same Internet connection.

MICROPROCESSOR

A microprocessor is a computer processor where the data processing logic and control is included on a single integrated circuit,
 or a small number of integrated circuits. 
The microprocessor contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry required to perform the functions of a computer's central processing unit.

7. What is transistor?
Ans: In electronics, a transistor is a semiconductor device commonly used to amplify or switch electronic signals.
 The transistor is the fundamental building block of computers, and all other modern electronic devices.
 Some transistors are packaged individually but most are found in integrated circuits
